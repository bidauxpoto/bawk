# bawk

### Installation using conda:
```conda install -c molinerislab bawk```

### Description:
A wrapper on ```gawk``` implementing the ability to name the columns of the input file according to the header.

### Usage and options:
```
bawk [--debug] [-f makefile] [-e|extended] [-v|assing var=val] [-M|meta] '{awk program}' INPUT_FILE

  -e|extend            change the regexp used to identify named fields: a named field like $$NF (with a double $)
                       is passed to awk as $NF and doesn't trigger the logic of named fields.
                       Be careful with the -e option: do not confuse $NF with NF. It is useful only if you want
                       to use a variabile to indicate a field number or if you want to pass shell variables to awk.
  -M|meta              print the .META for the given file and exit
  -v|assign var=val    assign the val to the variable var inside the bawk program
  -f makefile          ...
  --debug              ...

```
